# Simple-Bot-4-League

This is a simple program i made for leveling an account in the game League of Legends. 

I made this for fun for my own purposes. Basically what it does is just move around (and use basic attacks) so it doesn't get AFK detected. The code will automatically start a new game without any intervention up to a 100 times.

In my experience the accounts don't get punished for it.

How to use it:
- Have your map set on 50
- Have the Auto attack setting ON. (might not be necessary but it improves the performance of the bot and maybe avoids bot detection a bit better)
- Your client and in game client both need to have 16:9 dimensions (so 2560x1440, 1920x1080...) otherwise it won't work.
- You need to have python installed. Locate to the directory where the file is stored in the terminal and run the program using the command:  python bot.py
